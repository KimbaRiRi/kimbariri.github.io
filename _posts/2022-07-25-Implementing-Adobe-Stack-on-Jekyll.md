## Why is Adobe Implementation Tricky?


### Adobe needs to have a better structure for any technical implementation. 


Adobe, why do you have so many documents for the same subject?

Unlike Google or other suite programs, Adobe provided three different documents for bloody library tagging. Gees. 


- This website shows the Experience platform on a web tutorial. 

https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/configure-tags/add-embed-code.html?lang=en

- And this one shows how to implement stuff through tags.

https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extensions/adobe/target/overview.html?lang=en#adobe-target-extension-with-an-asynchronous-deployment

- And this is the target implementation guide. 
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/integrate/a4t/before-implement.html?lang=en

- And this is an implementation guide from the documentation. 

https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/home.html?lang=en

- And this is a deployment guide. 
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/launch/deploy-dev.html?lang=en

- And this is from the developer guide. 

https://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/

- And this is a Quickstart guide from Tags documentation. 
https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/get-started/quick-start.html



None of them is aligned linearly. 


#### Are you kidding me???

**So...Adobe, which one is the correct one? 


ðŸ™€

Once you find the correct documentation, the technicality is not tricky. 

All problems always stem from the loophole of their massive documentation dumps. 


And also, there are multiple deployments. By AT.js, Tag, and Server Side implementation. 

So Adobe, 

#### Which one do you mean I have to choooooooseeeeee?

Getting back to practicality, Web SDK is not supported within the organisation's sandbox. So this is out. The server-side is possibly out as well. 

This blog is based on a static site generator, so server-side implementation does not apply as well. However, I couldn't find the client-side option on Target 2, so I am not sure the device-only mode is just another labelling from the client side. Again, Adobe always changes the naming of functionalities of stacks, so I am not sure. 

Just in case, I also downloaded at.js and app management files from Adobe. 

However, I don't think these steps are needed. 


Whyyyyyy Target???? Why are you failing?!?!?

I can see that Adobe Analytics is correctly showing.

I can see that launch and Analytics are loaded up correctly. Dang.
