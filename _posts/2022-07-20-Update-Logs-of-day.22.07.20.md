### Website Update

- Adding grid stylings on works and side-project/sparkle page section on SCSS. 
- WIP Google Analytics library with correct ads Id
- Added more typography setups for posts and notes
- For the internal link outside of the "note" folder, I have to use \[Link Text\]\(\<\/'filepath'\>\) Syntax
- However, If I apply this to the page, it will work as external. 
- Added two project showcase pages. 
- Added posts that are linking to the "about-this-page" note.

#### Examples of changes are below: 

I added the portfolio showcase project "Macquarie Bank - Wealth Product."

### Marketing Tech Integration

I planned to implement Marketing tech tools on my page but it seems like adding a new showcase page took longer than I thought. 

- WIP with Google Analytics
- WIP with Adobe Target
