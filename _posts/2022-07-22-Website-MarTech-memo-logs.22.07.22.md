## Website logs and Today's findings


### Obsidian Template Links

I found crazy-awesome obsidian template references:

### Public Site Error Founding

#### 404 error while no issue on localhost

I didn't know this till now. Oh my god. What a disaster. Haven't I checked this? Of course, I did.
The cause was from github.io's quirk. 


Urrrrrrrr!!! ðŸ˜©

If you see that, It's not a problem on localhost at all.

#### Archive List Problems 


_Oops, I forgot to capture the screenshot of the issues about this._

Briefly speaking, the archive page did not show any posts and notes. I tried to figure out why. The Archive page was working fine before, and I didn't amend that function much. Was it permalink? Was it the wrong path? I was spending almost 2 hrs figuring out this. 


Now it's solved. Hugh.

However, it shows all notes, including notes I don't want to publish. 

So I added the 'Public' option inside of frontmatter and changed the liquid loop a bit.

Now it's showing correct results. 

For all issues, Did I write the wrong liquid syntax? Did I forget to close the brackets? None of them happened. The shitty part of the liquid syntax is, It's very sensitive to any line braces or white space within the template. That means I have to give up some of the 'beautify' options within the template. ðŸ˜©

#### How Do I Write the Posts

I write most of my notes via Obsidian. Most of the codes are, of course, written through visual studio code. However, I need grammar, typo, and wording checkup support as I skim texts a lot. (Typical for ADHDers)


That is why for the posting, I use Obsidian.
