**Doing what I do best**- documenting every single random thoughts and inspirations.

## Who Am I?

Hey, I am Gyuri. You can perhaps find me somewhere else on my meta id 'Kimba.RiRi' or 'KimbaRiRi'. Some people calls me Kimbo. Some may just butcher my name Gyuri, which is funny because most of people don't have problem at pronouncing 'Wa**gyu**'

Even the AI picks it up perfectly, y'all. 



## Why?
Mostly for my own reference, but also because I'm learning Jekyll as I edit this template. I'm doing this as a replacement for my previous portfolio [Digital Spacy Cat](https://spacecat.surge.sh/) which was based in Gatsby and other micro blogs from Tumblr and medium. Markdown and Obsidian help me gather knowledge and thoughts, plus write better content, faster.
