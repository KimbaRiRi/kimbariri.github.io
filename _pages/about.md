**Doing what I do best**- documenting every single random thoughts and inspirations.

## Why?
Mostly for my own reference, but also because I'm learning Jekyll as I edit this template. I'm doing this as a replacement for my previous portfolio [Digital Spacy Cat](https://spacecat.surge.sh/) which was based in Gatsby and other micro blogs from Tumblr and medium. Markdown and Obsidian help me gather knowledge and thoughts, plus write better content, faster.
