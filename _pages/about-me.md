**Doing what I do best**- documenting every single random thoughts and express inspirations in creative media.

## More about myself?

My name is Gyuri. You can perhaps find me somewhere else on my meta id 'Kimba.RiRi' or 'KimbaRiRi'. People call me
Kimbo (reference from Kim and Kath as I am Australian). Some may just butcher my name Gyuri, which is funny because most of people don't have problem at pronouncing
'Wa**gyu**'

I have mainly worked as a freelancer, I try to push out <a class="" href="/sideproject">Side Projects</a> regularly.

Even the AI picks it up perfectly, y'all.
