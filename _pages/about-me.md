You are doing what I do best**- documenting every single random thought and expressing inspiration in creative media.

## More about myself?

You can perhaps find me somewhere else on my meta id <em>'Kimba.RiRi'</em> or <em>'KimbaRiRi'</em>. Sometimes, People call me Kimbo (a reference to Kim and Kath from the Australian TV show). Some may butcher my name Gyuri, which is funny because most people don't have a problem pronouncing it.
'Wa**gyu**'

Even the AI picks it up perfectly, y'all.

Other than commercial projects, I also have lots of small side projects. They are listed here in <a class="" href="/sideproject">Side Projects</a>.
