I’d recommend using it as a CMS for managing your notes. See the page about Obsidian integration for more details.To see how to the raw markdown gets generated, go to the Test page to see how the raw markdown is renderedThe Custom features1. Creating a wiki-style linkGeneral SyntaxInternal links: [​[​Some Link]]Internal links with alternative text: [​[​Some Link\\|Alt text]]External links: [​[​Some Text::https://address-to-the-website**]]**Anything text inside a double square bracket is considered as an internal link. The text has to be a valid title, if you provide a random text inside double square brackets, it will showup highlighted in yellow telling you that there is no essay/article/file with the mentioned title.Similarly, for external links all you have to do is add a double colon after the “Alt text” and enter the link to the website after the double colon as seen below.ExamplesExample of an internal link that points to a valid post or page, that is, a page with the title (not url) mentioned in the double brackets.Raw Syntax: [​[​Obsidian integration]]Rendered Text: Obsidian integrationExample of an internal link that do not point to a valid post or page, that is, a page with the title (not url) mentioned in the double brackets.Raw Syntax: [​[Title of a non-existent page]]Rendered Text:[[Title of a non-existent page]]2. Creating a sidenote or a marginnoteGeneral SyntaxSidenote: [​[Some Text::keyword-of-the-type-of-the-sidenote]]Marginnote: [​[​Some Text**::keyword-of-the-type-of-the-marginnote]]**|Type of the sidenote/marginnote|keyword||:–|:–||Left Sidenote| lsn ||Right Sidenote | rsn ||Left Marginnote| lmn ||Right Marginnote | rmn |So, all you have to do is type in the keywords of the corresponding type of sidenote or marginnote after the double colon in the above syntaxExamplesExample of a sidenote to the right side of the page:Raw Syntax: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Vivamus fermentum efficitur justo non facilisis.7. Specific classes for changing font-type, font-size, and font-weightThere are classes like very-small, medium-small, small, small-medium, medium, medium-large, large, very-large; that can be used to change the size of your text directly from markdown like this:Raw Syntax:{:.regular-sans}{:.large}Some text here that needs to be enlargedRendered Text:{:.large}Some text here that needs to be enlargedSimilarly there are classes like regular-sans, serif, bold, italic, oblique, bolder, etc for formatting the text.Raw Syntax:{:.medium .serif .oblique}Some text here that needs to be enlargedRendered Text:{:.medium .serif .oblique}Some text here that needs to be enlargedOther common classes are .boxit that is used to wrap the text, .disable-user-select to disallow users from being able to select a particular piece of text by selecting it, etc. There are more classes like these which you can see in the file style.css. Once you figure out which class to use, all you have to do is just add the class before the text you want inside a curl brace like this ​{:&lt;classnames-with-dot-prepended-to-them&gt;​}8. Table of Contentnotenote.link supports automatic table of content (toc) generation. Just add a toc: true line in the front matter at the beginning of your post.You can modify the maximum header level included in the toc by changing number in the following option in config.yml :toc:  max_level: 39. Note maturitySince this jekyll theme aims at mirroring your Obsidian notebook, the note content may note be mature or complete yet.Therefore, we use front matter to classify the notes in the following categories (in order of appearance in the front page feed) :season: summer : the note is near-complete (more than 80% done)season: spring : the note is in progress and has already good contentseason: winter : the note has just started, a summary is present however.season: automn : the note needs refactoring or some rewriting. It won’t appear in the front-page feed.Why use seasons ? Since this theme is a form of ‘digital garden’, I thought it would make sense to keep the analogy.10. Other implicit features.Features like backlinks, context menu, related posts, page preview are available by default as they are implemented using CSS and JS. So, you don’t have to do anything other than write as you would normally to make use of those features."

      "url"      : "/how-to-setup-this-site",
      "content"  : "This is going to be a super simple post about how to setup and use this theme for your own website.Setup PrerequisitesFor this tutorial, we’ll need to install a few things on your machine (you may have some of these already). Following the instructions on each website to install them.-[[Ruby::https://www.ruby-lang.org/]]-[[RubyGems::https://rubygems.org/]]-[[Git::https://git-scm.com/downloads]]You’ll also need to create accounts on the following services:-[[GitHub::https://www.github.com/join]] (to store the website)-[[Netlify::https://app.netlify.com/signup]] (to serve the website so others can see)Once you are all set with the prerequisites, we can then get to the fun part of getting it to appear on your screen. Let’s get started with that.1. Create a fork of the template repositoryTo simplify things, I provide the template showed in the image above to get started. You can always tweak this template to your taste later.Visit the GitHub page for my template repository[[Maxence-L/notenote.link::https://github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link]], and fork it to your account using the Fork button:Once the forking process is complete, you should have a fork (essentially a copy) of my template in your own GitHub account. On the GitHub page for your repository, click on the green “Clone or download” button, and copy the URL: we’ll need it for the next step.2. Clone your repository locallyNext, we want to download the files from your GitHub repository onto your local machine. To do this, replace &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; in the command below with the URL you copied in the previous step, then execute this command:$ git clone &lt;YOUR_COPIED_URL_HERE&gt; my-personal-websiteAs a reference point, this is how it looks like for me (the difference is likely just the GitHub username):$ git clone git@github.com/Maxence-L/notenote.link my-personal-websiteThen, navigate into the directory that was just created:$ cd my-personal-website3. Test out the site locallySweet! You now have your repository’s source code on your machine. Within the my-personal-website directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies like Jekyll:$ bundleOnce that’s done, ask Jekyll to start serving the site locally:$ bundle exec jekyll serveThen, open up[[http://localhost:4000::http://localhost:4000]] in your browser.If everything’s done correctly, you should now see the home page of your Personal Jekyll Website with notenote.link Theme. 🎉Keep in mind that this site is only available locally (notice the localhost part of the URL), so if we want it to be available on the Internet for everyone to enjoy, we need to deploy it to the Internet: we’ll use Netlify for that in the next step.4. Connect your GitHub repository to NetlifyNetlify lets you automatically deploy your personal website on to the Internet when you update your GitHub repository. To do this, we need to connect your GitHub repository to Netlify:Log in to NetlifyOnce logged in, click the “New site from Git” buttonOn the next page, select GitHub as the continuous deployment provider (you may need to authorize the connection, in which case, approve it)On the next page, select your website repository from the list.On the next page, replace the basic build settings with the following.Type in “jekyll build” (without the quotes) inside the text field titled “Build Command”.Similarly type in “_site/” (without the quotes) inside the text field titled “Publish Directory”.On the next page, keep the default settings, and click on “Deploy site”.That was easy! We’re almost done.Wait a couple of minutes for the initial deploy to complete.Once that’s done, your website should be available on the Internet via a generic Netlify URL, which you can change to a custom domain later if you’d like.Now the cool thing is this: whenever you push an update to your GitHub repository, Netlify will automatically deploy your updates to the Internet.5. Start producing content :At this point, you can start updating the files on your machine (in the my-personal-website folder) to change your jekyll seamless based website to your liking: update the copy, add some notes, tweak the layout, customize the colors, etc. Once you have something you’re happy with, push your changes to your GitHub repository with the following commands:$ git add --all$ git commit -m 'Update content'$ git push origin masterIf that command succeeds and the rest of the tutorial was done correctly, in a couple of minutes, you should see your changes live on your Netlify website. 🚀And we’re done! You now have your own notenote.link based Personal Website .– About This Site –Link syntaxTo link to another note, you can use multiple syntaxes. The following four use the “double-bracket” notation (view the Markdown source file to see the underlying syntax).Using the note title variable:[[a note about cats]]Using the note’s filename:[[cats]]Using the note’s title, with a label:[[cats|link to the note about cats using the note title]]Using the note’s filename, with a label:[[cats|link to the note about cats using the note’s filename]]In all cases, if the double-bracket link does not point to a valid note, the double brackets will still be shown, like this:[[there is no note that matches this link]].Alternatively, you can use regular Markdown syntax for links.Since the Web is all about HTML, you can always use plain HTML if you want, like this: This is a link to the note about cats with HTML. Don’t forget to use the .internal-link class to make sure the link is styled as an internal link (without the little arrow).Of course, you can also link to external websites, like this: this is a link to Wikipedia. Again, you can use plain HTML if you prefer. Footnotes are also supported and will be treated like internal links.1Site configurationSome behavior is configurable by tweaking the _config.yml file.favicon: Insert an emoji and this will be generated as your site’s favicon automatically! This is only supported by browsers that recognize svg favicons, which is the majority of modern browsers.use_html_extension: if you use a static host that doesn’t support URLs that don’t end with .html (such as Neocities or Dreamhost), leave this as true in the _config.yml file. If you configure your .htaccess to remove extensions, remember to add link metadata for canonical URLs.open_external_links_in_new_tab: when set to true, this makes external links open in new tabs. Set to false to open all links in the current tab.url: Set to your full web URL including https://timezone: Set to your desired posting timezone so that the Last Modified At plugin displays the right date when you edit files.PagesSave static pages in the root directory in .md format. Each page needs to have the following at the top:---layout: pagetitle: About---Automatic bi-directional linksNotice in the “Notes mentioning this note” section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.Link previewsIf you’re on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes:[[a note about cats]].Images and other Markdown goodiesFinally, because you have the full power of Markdown in this template, you can use regular Markdown syntax for various formatting options.Lists work as expected:List element AList element BList element CList elementList elementList elementIf you’d like to quote other people, consider using quote blocks:Lorem ipsum dolor sit ametAnd of course, images look great:Code syntax highlightingYou can add code blocks with full syntax color highlighting by wrapping code snippet in triple backticks and specifying the type of the code (js, rb, sh, etc.):// Here's a bit of JavaScript:console.log('hello!')# And now some Rubydef foo(bar)  \"baz\"end$ cat /dev/urandom | grep \"the answer to life\" # shell scripts look nice tooArchiveThe archive page displays all notes in reverse chronological order.

When you build your site, these markdown files are converted to html and exported to the _site directory, which makes up your live website.Page Exceptionsindex.md is saved in the root directory so that I can use an include to README.md and avoid having to write the same content twice. Feel free to move this to _pages if you remove the include—the page will still render in the root directory once you build the site.Note FeaturesSince the notes are set up as a Jekyll collection rather than a post item, you cannot use built in category or tag features. The advantage of this is being able to name your note anything you want, rather than adhering to Jekyll’s requirement to add the date to a post filename.Since notes are technically a collection of pages, you can create your own variables. I’ve configured a custom variable called category: that you can use on notes. More info in Note Formatting.AssetsAll assets must be saved in the assets directory or they will not be built by Jekyll. By default, the Assets folder contains the following subfolders:cssimagesjsSave all attachments to the assets/images directory.

I’ve also enabled superscript, fractions, and disambiguation glyph set by default.Wremena is used for headings. I’ve enabled tabular numbers, just in case you add some numbers to your note titles.CSS ChangelogBody has a max width nowFont size is calculated to be intrinsically responsiveNo more inline styles, everything has a class or unique elementSemantic HTML, removed deprecated tagsRearranged &lt;article&gt; to only contain article text and nothing moreBacklinks are now an &lt;aside&gt;Separated font embeds to fonts.cssHeadings have hyphenated word breaks for large text on small devicesIncreased width for breakpoint to avoid squished gridsLots of variables in :root based on reducing opacity for the same primary theme colorAdded display: grid liberally when codeblocks broke the grid"

However, many renderers – like Github’s and Markdown Here – support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers);{:.regular-sans}Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.Inline code has back-ticks around it.Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```, or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks – they’re easier and only they support syntax highlighting. ```javascriptvar s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";alert(s);``` ```pythons = \"Python syntax highlighting\"print s``` ```No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a tag.```var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\";alert(s);s = \"Python syntax highlighting\"print sNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.{:#math}Math expressionsYou can write math expressions using the Latex markup language between dollar signs.They can be written inline (single-dollar signs $...$) or as a whole block (double dollar signs with a line above and under $$...$$).For example,Bayes Theorem is $P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$will render as :Bayes Theorem is : $P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$WhereasBayes Theorem is :$$P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$will render as :Bayes Theorem is :$$P(A \\vert B) = \\frac{P(B \\vert A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$Please note that for a math block to be displayed correctly, it needs to be separated by an empty line, above and below. Besides, the pipe character | may conflict with Markdown : it is recommended to use \\vert instead.{:#tables}TablesTables aren’t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them.

Heavily inspired by Maggie’s Digital Gardening Project.This website is currently being hosted on Github. The reason is that:It’s free.As I am actively pushing my updates to my own github, it just makes sense to deploy directly to Github.I couldn’t find any valid reason to deploy through Netflify or Vercel. I may consider it in future- I don’t know. This whole Obsidian syncing to Jekyll thing is very experimental to me.Originally, I was publishing my personal website with the Gatsby integrating with WordPress on headless CMS way. However, figuring out how incorporate the Gatsby way with WP API was too much hustles. If this was required by my work, I will do it (well because I am paid for it). For the personal website? That’s too much. The consistent updates and checking the dependencies on node &amp; npm version was exhausting me out as well.Next Milestone is…[WIP] Start migrating css to scss format[WIP ] Add 2nd post[ ] Start migrating all js within html pages and markdowns within organised folder structures[ ] Configure the Obsidian biredirect link into based on the folder structure[ ] Adding Search Option[ ] Figuring out the Wiki stacks within this website[ ] Add a comments plugin (Disqus)[ ] Install a remote theme[ ] Learn how to add gists to the posts[ ] Add reading time to posts[ ] Install a plugin to speed up post creation (jekyll-compose)[ ] Try out the static comments option"
