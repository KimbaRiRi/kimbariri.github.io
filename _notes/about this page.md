### Welcome!
This is my first note of this website. This website is based from [Obsidian](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Internal+link) and Megumi's [Green Template](https://github.com/meewgumi/green-web-template). Heavily inspired by [Maggie's Digital Gardening Project](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). 

This website is currently being hosted by Github. The reason is that: 

1. It's free. 
2. As I am actively pushing my updates to my own github, it just makes sense to deploy directly to Github. 
3. I couldn't find any valid reason to deploy through **Netflify** or **Vercel**. I might be in future- I don't know. This whole **Obsidian** syncing to **Jekyll** thing is very experimental to me.
