GTM is equivalent to Adobe Target.\n\nPaste your Google Tag Manager snippets into your partial html file. (inside of ‘_includes’)\n\nGoogle Optimize\nThis is the dashboard of Google Optimize. It’s similar to Adobe Target.\n\nGoogle Analytics\nIn order to install the GA into the Jekyll, you may face some configuration issues. In that case refer to this tutorial https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/ and https://morotsman.github.io/blog,/google/analytics,/jekyll,/github/pages/2020/07/07/add-google-analytics.html\nhttps://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/\nOf course, The google Analytics must link to the Google Optimize.\n\nFor extra step, I also installed the ‘’ of MicroSoft.\nSome Extra helpful links about Analytics\nhttps://www.pedromonjo.com/\nhttps://www.stevefenton.co.uk/category/analytics/\nTo do list\n\nI found an error about categories of notes. Noooooo\n\n\nAdobe Extension Installation is not easy…because\nTheir documentation deck is huge, thus not so well organised AT ALL!\nTo find an answer you seek on every single step, you will fell into the rabbit holes so easily.\nAnother thing that annoyed me was, the documentation is not so up-to-date while Adobe constantly changes their UI structures inside of AEP dashboards.\n\nAnother tricky step was finding the extension menu. Adobe document did not mention how to find extension. Aren’t you supposed to explain that I have to make a tag property first before finding extension tab? Gees…\n\nAfter hopping through a couple of confusions, I finally managed to find the production and development library.\n\nAnd finally installed required extensions. From my organisation’s sandbox, I was not allowed to adopt the webSDK. Well, I at least was able to install experience client ID service so this should be enough.\nAdobe is powerful indeed but I already fill the setting progress is a bit overkill now.\n\nIt was quite hustle to find correct document references within adobe experience league. I wish they could have arrayed the contents better.\nAnyway, for the web base implementation - refer to this link.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/overview.html?lang=en\nAnd this is specifically for Analytics report suite.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/manage-report-suites/new-report-suite/t-create-a-report-suite.html?lang=en\nUseful link telling details about Markdown\nThis link was quite useful. Nice to have.\nhttps://blog.bianxi.com/2021/09/25/how-to-use-markdown-for-writing-technical-documentation/"
