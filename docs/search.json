      "content"  : "Why is Adobe Implementation Tricky?\nAdobe needs to have a better structure for any technical implementation.\nAdobe, why do you have so many documents for the same subject?\nUnlike Google or other suite programs, Adobe provided multiple documents for bloody library tagging. Gees.\nNo, seriously. To find out to correctly implement the target on my website, how many documents did I end up with?\n\nThis website shows the Experience platform on a web tutorial.\n\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/configure-tags/add-embed-code.html?lang=en\n\nAnd this one shows how to implement stuff through tags.\n\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extensions/adobe/target/overview.html?lang=en#adobe-target-extension-with-an-asynchronous-deployment\n\n\nAnd this is the target implementation guide.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/integrate/a4t/before-implement.html?lang=en\n\n\nAnd this is an implementation guide from the documentation.\n\n\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/home.html?lang=en\n\n\nAnd this is a deployment guide.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/launch/deploy-dev.html?lang=en\n\n\nAnd this is from the developer guide.\n\n\nhttps://developer.adobe.com/target/implement/client-side/\n\nAnd this is a Quickstart guide from Tags documentation.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/get-started/quick-start.html\n\nNone of them is aligned linearly. \nAre you kidding me???\nSo‚Ä¶Adobe, which one is the correct one?\nüôÄ\nOnce you find the correct documentation, the technicality is not tricky.\nAll problems always stem from the loophole of their massive documentation dumps.\nAnd also, there are multiple deployments. By AT.js, Tag, and Server Side implementation.\nSo Adobe,\nWhich one do you mean I have to choooooooseeeeee?\n\n\nGetting back to practicality, Web SDK is not supported within the organisation‚Äôs sandbox. So this is out. The server-side is possibly out as well.\nThis blog is based on a static site generator, so server-side implementation also does not apply. However, I couldn‚Äôt find the client-side option on Target 2, so I am not sure the device-only mode is just another labelling from the client side. Again, Adobe constantly changes the naming of functionalities of stacks, so I am not sure.\nJust in case, I also downloaded at.js and other adobe analytics libraries from code manager. However, the tag script handled analytics well, except for the target v2.\nHmmm‚Ä¶\nüòë\nAs you see, the client ID and app measurement kick in alright.\n\nI checked the omnibug as well.\nGoogle Tag Manager, MS Clarity, Google Analytics, and Adobe Analytics appeared.\nWait, why do I have launch twice? We will worry about it later.\n\n\n\n\n\nArhhhhh!!!!! (Pulls hairs)\n\nü§¨\nAs I can see the analytics kicking in without problems, I don‚Äôt know what tag I am missing to put, honestly.  **Helllllp!"

Oh my god. What a disaster. Haven‚Äôt I checked this? Of course, I did.\nThe cause was from github.io‚Äôs quirk.\nUrrrrrrrr!!! üò©\n\n\n\nIf you see that, It‚Äôs not a problem on localhost at all.\n\nAnd I found some script that is lowering the capital case of URLs into the lowercase-Jekyll template URL. Let‚Äôs try that.\nNope. 404 errors due to XSS policies on the browser.\nBugger!\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, I solved this issue by changing it from ‚Äò: title‚Äô to ‚Äò: slug.‚Äô\nReferences:\nhttps://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/how-to-link/\nhttps://gist.github.com/sbliven/0ca4dee4e0190a6b3dc7e3d8040cc395?permalink_comment_id=3526205\nImage link does not correctly work on posts\nThis issue is also, again, due to the file path. It may require me to write some Ruby Plugin‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs too much hustle to think about.\nThis is what it looks like when I attach the images to the posts.\n\n\nWhen they are HTML-fied, Those image links get broken.\n\nI manually changed the location via visual studio code for a quick solution.\nThis issue only happens within the journal post. The note is absolutely fine.\n\nThe trick is just simply changing the file path.\n\nThis only applies to posts for now.\nThing is, even though everything is looking alright with localhost, you never know with the deployment. QA is a big job, indeed.\nArchive List Problems\nOops, I forgot to capture the screenshot of the issues about this.\nBriefly speaking, the archive page did not show any posts and notes. I tried to figure out why. The Archive page was working fine before, and I didn‚Äôt amend that function much. Was it permalink? Was it the wrong path? I was spending almost 2 hrs figuring out this.\nNow it‚Äôs solved. Hugh.\n\nHowever, it shows all notes, including notes I don‚Äôt want to publish.\nSo I added the ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô option inside the frontmatter and changed the liquid loop slightly.\n\n\n\nNow it‚Äôs showing correct results.\nFor all issues, Did I write the wrong liquid syntax? Did I forget to close the brackets? None of them happened. The shitty part of the liquid syntax is, It‚Äôs very sensitive to any line braces or white space within the template. That means I have to give up some of the ‚Äòbeautify‚Äô options within the template. üò©\nHow Do I Setup SEO on Jekyll + Github?\nThis is still ongoing test. I am not sure how github.io is webcrowler friendly.\nAs I already wrote quite bits of meta tags, I don‚Äôt feel like installing Jekyll gem for feed and SEO is necessary. We will see.\nThis is all I added on head.html.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://jsinibardy.com/optimize-seo-jekyll#install-jekyll-sitemap-and-optimize-date-management\nhttps://blog.mastykarz.nl/improve-jekyll-seo/\nhttps://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/help-on-google-indexing-and-seo-plugin/5729\nhttp://jekyll.github.io/jekyll-seo-tag/advanced-usage/\nHow Do I Write the Posts and Publish to KimbaRiRi.Github.io?\nI write most of my notes via Obsidian. Most of the codes are, of course, written through visual studio code. However, I need grammar, typo, and wording checkup support as I skim texts a lot. (Typical for ADHDers)\nThat is why for the posting, I use Obsidian. You can see that Grammarly pick up some word reviews within the notes.\n\nWithin the Obsidian, Enable the template core plugin. Inside of obsidian templates, you can set up the skeleton template.\n\nInside of each template, they do have the skeleton format.\n\nAnd this plugin helps me to write the post as Jekyll only accept the post file name starting from a date like this ‚ÄòYear-Month-Day‚Äô\n\nIn order to generate the correct image and HTML file link, I borrowed the plug-in from https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/maximevaillancourt.com\n\nHowever, this plug-in is only specified for notes and posts. The way I formulate notes and posts is different to their Ruby plugin sets. For that reason, I have to write separate plugins only for posts.\nWell, if I have some time. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt üò≠ . Also, I sometimes move what I wrote from posts to notes, so It‚Äôs no use to config existing note plugins. I am treating my daily posts as some kind of quick draft stage before populating notes.\nFor that reason, I am happy with manually replacing some file routes if I need to. For now.\nThis is the base folder of notes.\n\n\nFor now, the asset path is based on the posts folder, but this will be changed to notes at some point.\n\nYou can generate vaults from the existing folder.\n\nAnd Based on the setup of Jekyll, your writings on markdown files via Obsidian will be generated into HTML format.\n\nAfter doing so, you got now rendered HTML files. The last step is deploying your generated HTML files into your GitHub or bitbucket (whatever your deployment cycle is)\n\nIndeed, I do have multiple vaults. Personal Wiki is for this Jekyll posting. BrainDumpster is literally for dumpling any random thought pieces. Cross-Device is a lightweight vault as I sometimes write stuff on my phone while I have no access to the laptop (e.g. commuting).\nLuckly, git-note from Android Phone does enable me to do this. I am not sure about iPhone. There was a terminal source management app within iPad but it was bloody slow.\nI also often write my thought notes via Google Voice Keyboard. It‚Äôs not perfect but helps me to write when I don‚Äôt want to look at the screen. For accuracy-wise, Otter.io would be the better option though.\n\nYou may need web programming skills to publish your obsidian posts and notes. If that is you, consider subscribing to obsidian ‚ÄòPublish‚Äô service. As I am quite confident to utilise Git, I don‚Äôt need one.\nHow to solve conflicts\nIn the most laziest way?\nIf you don‚Äôt give a F about losing your changes, simple choose ‚ÄúResolve Using ‚ÄòTheirs‚Äô‚Äù.\nI often do this when I know exactly what my changes are or all I need to replace is a compiled build.\n\nMore conveniently, If you open the conflict files via VSC, VSC will smartly show which parts are conflicting. You can choose either accept current (your local codes) or incoming changes (merging one).\n\nRandom Rant\nI am a crazy purple shipper. Even my VSC theme is ‚Äòshade of purple‚Äô."

Injecting the library was not a matter, but the correct configuration along with Jekyll and github.io was tricky.\nWhat‚Äôs implemented?\nClarity is WIP.\nReferences:\nhttps://clarity.microsoft.com/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/clarity-setup\n\nOr you can do manually.\n\nToday‚Äôs website update\nDue to the issue I found above; I struggled to solve the problems. I was toying around with permalink setups, tag for loop syntax, changing the note folder structures, etc. None of them worked. While I was frustrated about it, one slightest idea came up to my head. I put all tags inside of the ‚Äò[]‚Äô brackets. Since so, the tag categorisation amazingly works fine.\n\n\n\nIt seems to be working fine now :)\nAbleton Beginner Chapter\nAbleton Tutorial Document\nGoogle Tag Manager\nTutorial Link: Google Official Guide\nDashboard Google Tag Manager Admin\nData Layer guide: Google Data Layer\nGo to the Google Tag Manager. GTM is equivalent to Adobe Target.\nPaste your Google Tag Manager snippets into your partial HTML file. (inside of ‚Äò_includes‚Äô)\nGoogle Optimize\nThis is the dashboard of Google Optimize. It‚Äôs similar to Adobe Target.\n\nGoogle Analytics\nIn order to install the GA into the Jekyll, you may face some configuration issues. In that case refer to this tutorial https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/ and https://morotsman.github.io/blog,/google/analytics,/jekyll,/github/pages/2020/07/07/add-google-analytics.html\nhttps://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/\nOf course, The google Analytics must link to the Google Optimize.\nFor extra step, I also installed the ‚Äò‚Äô of MicroSoft.\nSome Extra helpful links about Analytics\nhttps://www.pedromonjo.com/\nhttps://www.stevefenton.co.uk/category/analytics/\nAdobe Extension Installation is not easy‚Ä¶because\nTheir documentation deck is huge, thus not so well organised AT ALL!\nTo find an answer you seek on every single step, you will fell into the rabbit holes so easily.\nAnother thing that annoyed me was, the documentation is not so up-to-date while Adobe constantly changes their UI structures inside of AEP dashboards.\n\nAnother tricky step was finding the extension menu. Adobe document did not mention how to find extension. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to explain that I have to make a tag property first before finding extension tab? Gees‚Ä¶\n\nAfter hopping through a couple of confusions, I finally managed to find the production and development library.\nAnd finally installed required extensions. From my organisation‚Äôs sandbox, I was not allowed to adopt the webSDK. Well, I at least was able to install experience client ID service so this should be enough.\nAdobe is powerful indeed but I already fill the setting progress is a bit overkill now.\n\nIt was quite hustle to find correct document references within adobe experience league. I wish they could have arrayed the contents better.\nAnyway, for the web base implementation - refer to this link.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/overview.html?lang=en\nAnd this is specifically for Analytics report suite.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/manage-report-suites/new-report-suite/t-create-a-report-suite.html?lang=en\nUseful link telling details about Markdown\nThis link was quite useful.
