      "content"  : "Website logs and Today’s findings\nObsidian Template Links\nI found crazy-awesome obsidian template references:\n\nhttps://thebuccaneersbounty.wordpress.com/2022/01/05/how-i-use-the-daily-notes-plugin-a-comprehensive-guide/\nhttps://agileadam.com/2022/07/obsidian-daily-note-implementation-v2/\n\nPublic Site Error Founding\n404 error while no issue on localhost\nI didn’t know this till now. Oh my god. What a disaster. Haven’t I checked this? Of course, I did.\nThe cause was from github.io’s quirk.\nUrrrrrrrr!!! 😩\n\n\nReferences:\nhttps://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/how-to-link/\nhttps://gist.github.com/sbliven/0ca4dee4e0190a6b3dc7e3d8040cc395?permalink_comment_id=3526205\nArchive List Problems\nOops, I forgot to capture the screenshot of the issues about this.\nBriefly speaking, the archive page did not show any posts and notes. I tried to figure out why. The Archive page was working fine before, and I didn’t amend that function much. Was it permalink? Was it the wrong path? I was spending almost 2 hrs figuring out this.\nNow it’s solved. Hugh.\n\nHowever, it shows all notes, including notes I don’t want to publish.\nSo I added the ‘Public’ option inside of frontmatter and changed the liquid loop a bit.\n\n\nNow it’s showing correct results.\nFor all issues, Did I write the wrong liquid syntax? Did I forget to close the brackets? None of them happened. The shitty part of the liquid syntax is, It’s very sensitive to any line braces or white space within the template. That means I have to give up some of the ‘beautify’ options within the template. 😩\nHow Do I Write the Posts\nI write most of my notes via Obsidian. Most of the codes are, of course, written through visual studio code. However, I need grammar, typo, and wording checkup support as I skim texts a lot. (Typical for ADHDers)\nThat is why for the posting, I use Obsidian."

      "content"  : "To-do list\n“I found an error about categories of notes. Noooooo!!!”\n\nImplementing Adobe suite and google suite took longer than I thought. Injecting the library was not a matter, but the correct configuration along with Jekyll and github.io was tricky.\nToday’s website update\nDue to the issue I found above; I struggled to solve the problems. I was toying around with permalink setups, tag for loop syntax, changing the note folder structures, etc. None of them worked. While I was frustrated about it, one slightest idea came up to my head. I put all tags inside of the ‘[]’ brackets. Since so, the tag categorisation amazingly works fine.\n\n\n\nIt seems to be working fine now :)\nAbleton Beginner Chapter\nAbleton Tutorial Document\nGoogle Tag Manager\nTutorial Link: Google Official Guide\nDashboard Google Tag Manager Admin\nData Layer guide: Google Data Layer\nGo to the Google Tag Manager. GTM is equivalent to Adobe Target.\nPaste your Google Tag Manager snippets into your partial HTML file. (inside of ‘_includes’)\nGoogle Optimize\nThis is the dashboard of Google Optimize. It’s similar to Adobe Target.\n\nGoogle Analytics\nIn order to install the GA into the Jekyll, you may face some configuration issues. In that case refer to this tutorial https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/ and https://morotsman.github.io/blog,/google/analytics,/jekyll,/github/pages/2020/07/07/add-google-analytics.html\nhttps://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/\nOf course, The google Analytics must link to the Google Optimize.\nFor extra step, I also installed the ‘’ of MicroSoft.\nSome Extra helpful links about Analytics\nhttps://www.pedromonjo.com/\nhttps://www.stevefenton.co.uk/category/analytics/\nAdobe Extension Installation is not easy…because\nTheir documentation deck is huge, thus not so well organised AT ALL!\nTo find an answer you seek on every single step, you will fell into the rabbit holes so easily.\nAnother thing that annoyed me was, the documentation is not so up-to-date while Adobe constantly changes their UI structures inside of AEP dashboards.\n\nAnother tricky step was finding the extension menu. Adobe document did not mention how to find extension. Aren’t you supposed to explain that I have to make a tag property first before finding extension tab? Gees…\n\nAfter hopping through a couple of confusions, I finally managed to find the production and development library.\nAnd finally installed required extensions. From my organisation’s sandbox, I was not allowed to adopt the webSDK. Well, I at least was able to install experience client ID service so this should be enough.\nAdobe is powerful indeed but I already fill the setting progress is a bit overkill now.\n\nIt was quite hustle to find correct document references within adobe experience league. I wish they could have arrayed the contents better.\nAnyway, for the web base implementation - refer to this link.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-in-websites/overview.html?lang=en\nAnd this is specifically for Analytics report suite.\nhttps://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/manage-report-suites/new-report-suite/t-create-a-report-suite.html?lang=en\nUseful link telling details about Markdown\nThis link was quite useful. Nice to have.\nhttps://blog.bianxi.com/2021/09/25/how-to-use-markdown-for-writing-technical-documentation/\n**Once enough contexts are formulated for certain subjects, some of content blocks will be moved to notes."
