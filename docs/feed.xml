<h4 id="error-while-no-issue-on-localhost">404 error while no issue on localhost</h4>
<p>I didn‚Äôt know this till now. Oh my god. What a disaster. Haven‚Äôt I checked this? Of course, I did.
The cause was from github.io‚Äôs quirk.</p>
<p>Urrrrrrrr!!! üò©</p>

<p>If you see that, It‚Äôs not a problem on localhost at all.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 11.30.39 am.png">
<p>And I found some script that is lowering the capital case of URLs into the lowercase-Jekyll template URL. Let‚Äôs try that.</p>
<p>Nope. 404 errors due to XSS policies on the browser.</p>
<p>Bugger!</p>

<p>In the end, I solved this issue by changing it from ‚Äò: title‚Äô to ‚Äò: slug.‚Äô</p>

<h4 id="image-link-does-not-correctly-work-on-posts">Image link does not correctly work on posts</h4>
<p>This issue is also, again, due to the file path. It may require me to write some Ruby Plugin‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs too much hustle to think about.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like when I attach the images to the posts.</p>
<!-- <img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 11.52.15 am.png"> -->
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 11.52.15 am.png">
<p>When they are HTML-fied, Those image links get broken.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 11.52.04 am.png">
<p>I manually changed the location via visual studio code for a quick solution.</p>
<p>This issue only happens within the journal post. The note is absolutely fine.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 11.57.49 am.png">
<p>The trick is just simply changing the file path.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.08.17 pm.png">
<p>This only applies to posts for now.</p>
<p>Thing is, even though everything is looking alright with localhost, you never know with the deployment. QA is a big job, indeed.</p>
<h4 id="archive-list-problems">Archive List Problems</h4>
<p><em>Oops, I forgot to capture the screenshot of the issues about this.</em></p>
<p>Briefly speaking, the archive page did not show any posts and notes. I tried to figure out why. The Archive page was working fine before, and I didn‚Äôt amend that function much. Was it permalink? Was it the wrong path? I was spending almost 2 hrs figuring out this.</p>
<p>Now it‚Äôs solved. Hugh.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 10.32.37 am.png">
<p>However, it shows all notes, including notes I don‚Äôt want to publish.</p>
<p>So I added the ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô option inside the frontmatter and changed the liquid loop slightly.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 10.46.34 am.png">
<br/>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 10.46.41 am.png">
<p>Now it‚Äôs showing correct results.</p>
<p>For all issues, Did I write the wrong liquid syntax? Did I forget to close the brackets? None of them happened. The shitty part of the liquid syntax is, It‚Äôs very sensitive to any line braces or white space within the template. That means I have to give up some of the ‚Äòbeautify‚Äô options within the template. üò©</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-setup-seo-on-jekyll--github">How Do I Setup SEO on Jekyll + Github?</h3>
<p>This is still ongoing test. I am not sure how github.io is webcrowler friendly.</p>
<p>As I already wrote quite bits of meta tags, I don‚Äôt feel like installing Jekyll gem for feed and SEO is necessary. We will see.</p>
<p>This is all I added on head.html.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-i-write-the-posts-and-publish-to-kimbaririgithubio">How Do I Write the Posts and Publish to KimbaRiRi.Github.io?</h3>
<p>I write most of my notes via Obsidian. Most of the codes are, of course, written through visual studio code. However, I need grammar, typo, and wording checkup support as I skim texts a lot. (Typical for ADHDers)</p>
<p>That is why for the posting, I use Obsidian. You can see that Grammarly pick up some word reviews within the notes.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 11.02.50 am.png">
<p>Within the Obsidian, Enable the template core plugin. Inside of obsidian templates, you can set up the skeleton template.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.31.02 pm.png">
<p>Inside of each template, they do have the skeleton format.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.32.25 pm.png">
<p>And this plugin helps me to write the post as Jekyll only accept the post file name starting from a date like this ‚ÄòYear-Month-Day‚Äô</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.34.33 pm.png">
<p>In order to generate the correct image and HTML file link, I borrowed the plug-in from <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/maximevaillancourt.com">https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/maximevaillancourt.com</a></p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.35.52 pm.png">
<p>However, this plug-in is only specified for notes and posts. The way I formulate notes and posts is different to their Ruby plugin sets. For that reason, I have to write separate plugins only for posts.</p>
<p>Well, if I have some time. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt üò≠ . Also, I sometimes move what I wrote from posts to notes, so It‚Äôs no use to config existing note plugins. I am treating my daily posts as some kind of quick draft stage before populating notes.</p>
<p>For that reason, I am happy with manually replacing some file routes if I need to. For now.</p>
<p>This is the base folder of notes.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.39.42 pm.png">
<br/>
<p>For now, the asset path is based on the posts folder, but this will be changed to notes at some point.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.39.47 pm.png">
<p>You can generate vaults from the existing folder.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.43.38 pm.png">
<p>And Based on the setup of Jekyll, your writings on markdown files via Obsidian will be generated into HTML format.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.44.52 pm.png">
<p>After doing so, you got now rendered HTML files. The last step is deploying your generated HTML files into your GitHub or bitbucket (whatever your deployment cycle is)</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.45.59 pm.png">
<p>Indeed, I do have multiple vaults. Personal Wiki is for this Jekyll posting. BrainDumpster is literally for dumpling any random thought pieces. Cross-Device is a lightweight vault as I sometimes write stuff on my phone while I have no access to the laptop (e.g. commuting).</p>
<p>Luckly, git-note from Android Phone does enable me to do this. I am not sure about iPhone. There was a terminal source management app within iPad but it was bloody slow.</p>
<p>I also often write my thought notes via Google Voice Keyboard. It‚Äôs not perfect but helps me to write when I don‚Äôt want to look at the screen. For accuracy-wise, Otter.io would be the better option though.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 12.48.08 pm.png">
<p>You may need web programming skills to publish your obsidian posts and notes. If that is you, consider subscribing to obsidian ‚ÄòPublish‚Äô service. As I am quite confident to utilise Git, I don‚Äôt need one.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-solve-conflicts">How to solve conflicts</h3>
<p>In the most laziest way?</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt give a F about losing your changes, simple choose ‚ÄúResolve Using ‚ÄòTheirs‚Äô‚Äù.</p>
<p>I often do this when I know exactly what my changes are or all I need to replace is a compiled build.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//posts/Screen Shot 2022-07-22 at 5.46.50 pm.png">
<p>More conveniently, If you open the conflict files via VSC, VSC will smartly show which parts are conflicting. You can choose either accept current (your local codes) or incoming changes (merging one).</p>

<p>Due to the issue I found above; I struggled to solve the problems. I was toying around with permalink setups, tag for loop syntax, changing the note folder structures, etc. None of them worked. While I was frustrated about it, one slightest idea came up to my head. I put all tags inside of the ‚Äò[]‚Äô brackets. Since so, the tag categorisation amazingly works fine.</p>

<h4 id="adobe-extension-installation-is-not-easybecause">Adobe Extension Installation is not easy‚Ä¶because</h4>
<p>Their documentation deck is huge, thus not so well organised AT ALL!</p>
<p>To find an answer you seek on every single step, you will fell into the rabbit holes so easily.
Another thing that annoyed me was, the documentation is not so up-to-date while Adobe constantly changes their UI structures inside of AEP dashboards.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 4.22.10 pm.png">
<p>Another tricky step was finding the extension menu. Adobe document did not mention how to find extension. Aren‚Äôt you supposed to explain that I have to make a tag property first before finding extension tab? Gees‚Ä¶</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 4.55.27 pm.png">
<p>After hopping through a couple of confusions, I finally managed to find the production and development library.</p>
<p>And finally installed required extensions. From my organisation‚Äôs sandbox, I was not allowed to adopt the webSDK. Well, I at least was able to install experience client ID service so this should be enough.</p>
<p>Adobe is powerful indeed but I already fill the setting progress is a bit overkill now.</p>
<img src="/assets/images//notes/Screen Shot 2022-07-21 at 4.52.12 pm.png">
