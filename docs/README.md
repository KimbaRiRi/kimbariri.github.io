## What is this?

A digital garden using a custom version of `simply-jekyll`, notenote.link's template, meewgumi's greenweb template, and optimised for integration with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It is more oriented on note-taking and aims to help myself build a nice knowledge base (or ramdom things) that can scale with time. Another inspiration that I applied from is Johngrib's wiki (https://github.com/johngrib/johngrib-jekyll-skeleton) 

**The live version is here: [kimbariri.github.io](https://kimbariri.github.io)**

## What is different?

- Markdown is fully-compatible with Obsidian (including Latex delimiters!)
- Code is now correctly indented

## How do I use this?
